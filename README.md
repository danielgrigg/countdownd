# countdownd

Really need to update this...

countdown is a little webapp to create 'countdown' timers. It consists
of two pages, a page to create a timer with a name & details, followed 
by a page to view any existing countdown.

Handy say if you have an event coming up and want a web-timer for it..

Mostly the project's to demonstrate creating a webapp purely with Clojure
and Clojurescript. Specifically using Ring, Compojure and Hiccup.

## Usage

For now check the deploy folder for instructions installing to a ubuntu server.
