Ubuntu deployment
=========

The process is crude but straightforward.  We use the lein-ring plugin 
to launch the server, so the server-install just needs an upstart job
to run lein from wherever countdownd is installed.  

I assume you'll have a user and run the server unprivileged.
countdown runs on port 8080 by default, edit countdownd.conf to change. 
Since we're unprivileged, if you want to run port 80, iptables is the easiest
solution imo, ie:

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080


# bootstrap lein 
scp deploy/scbootstrap.sh $USERNAME@$HOST
ssh usernam@host "sh ./bootstrap.sh"

# copy countdown.conf to /etc/init/
# First edit countdown.conf and set RUN_AS to the $USERNAME running countdownd,

scp deploy/countdown.conf username@host:/tmp
ssh -t "sudo mv /tmp/countdown.conf /etc/init/countdown.conf"

# sync the repo to the server.  Note cljsbuild seems flaky so make sure 
# when you later run countdownd that resources/public/js/main.js exists.  Else 
# try building locally&copying, rerunning cljsbuild from the server etc...

sh deploy/scdeploy.sh $USERNAME $HOST

# fire it up!
ssh -t $ADMIN@$HOST "sudo start countdownd"

# Logs are written to /var/log/countdownd/countdown.log
